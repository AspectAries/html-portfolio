<h2>Personal Horror Favorites.</h2>

<h3>Cult of Chucky</h3>
<h4>8.5/10</h4>
<p>One of my favorite movies to come to <br />for awesome gore and timeless jokes.</p>
<h3>Hush</h3>
<h4>10/10</h4>
<p>Still and probably always will be one of the most creative<br />
films I've ever watched.</p>
<h3>Freddy vs. Jason</h3>
<h4>5/10</h4>
<p>Honestly, one of the most traumatizing films watched and<br />
literally the only reason I enjoy horror now.</p>
